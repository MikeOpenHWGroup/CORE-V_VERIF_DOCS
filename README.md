# CORE-V_VERIF_DOCS
Experimental repo to facilitate translation of existing core-v-docs documents to reStructuredText and a readthedocs flow.

The readthedocs rendering of the Verification Strategy can be viewed [here](https://core-v-verif-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

Created using Sphinx.  If you have never used Sphinx
[here](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html) is a good gentle introduction.
