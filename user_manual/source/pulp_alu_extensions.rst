PULP ALU Extensions
===================

CV32E40P supports advanced ALU operations that allow to perform multiple
instructions that are specified in the base instruction set in one
single instruction and thus increases efficiency of the core. For
example, those instructions include zero-/sign-extension instructions
for 8-bit and 16-bit operands, simple bit manipulation/counting
instructions and min/max/avg instructions.

The ALU does also support saturating, clipping, and normalizing
instructions which make fixed-point arithmetic more efficient.
