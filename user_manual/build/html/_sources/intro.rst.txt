Introduction
============

This document captures the methods, verification environment
architectures and tools used to verify the first two members CORE-V
family of RISC-V cores, the CV32E and CV64A.

The OpenHW Group will, together with its Member Companies, execute a
complete, industrial grade pre-silicon verification of the first
generation of CORE-V IP, the CV32E and CV64A cores, including their
execution environment [1]_. Experience has shown that “complete”
verification requires the application of both dynamic (simulation, FPGA
prototyping, emulation) and static (formal) verification techniques. All
of these techniques will be applied to both CV32E and CV64A.
